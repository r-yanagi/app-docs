## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How to Play

**Q: What are the game rules?**

A: This is a game where you measure the target seconds displayed on screen (e.g., 5.0 seconds) using your internal clock without watching the timer.

1. Tap to start
2. Tap again when you think the target time has passed
3. Results are displayed and score is added

**Q: How can I get a high score?**

A: Focus on these points:

- Minimize error (perfect within 0.01s)
- Build multipliers through consecutive successes
- Continuing perfects stacks multipliers up to ×1.5 each time

### Scoring System

**Q: How is the score calculated?**

A: Score is calculated as "Base Points × Multiplier".

**Base Points (by error):**
- 0.00s: 100 points
- Within 0.05s: 80 points
- Within 0.10s: 60 points
- Within 0.30s: 40 points
- Above: 0-40 points

**Multiplier (by consecutive success):**
- Perfect: ×1.5
- Within 0.05s: ×1.3
- Within 0.10s: ×1.2
- Within 0.30s: ×1.1

Multipliers stack, so the more consecutive successes, the higher your potential score!

**Q: What is LIMIT?**

A: LIMIT is HP (Health Points). Large errors deal damage, and when LIMIT reaches 0, it's game over.

- 1 second error = 50 damage
- Maximum LIMIT: 100

### Data and Save

**Q: Where is data stored?**

A: All data (scores, best scores, etc.) is stored in local device storage. It is not transmitted to external servers.

**Q: My data disappeared**

- App was uninstalled

The current version does not support cloud backup.

**Q: Can I transfer data to another device?**

### Advertising

**Q: Can I disable ads?**

A: The current version does not have a feature to completely disable ads. Ads are displayed to support app operations.

**Q: Ads don't appear after game over**

A: This could be due to:

1. Ads haven't loaded yet (immediately after first launch)
2. Network connection issues
3. No ad delivery in your region

Please try again after waiting a moment.

**Q: How do I continue by watching an ad?**

A: When a reward ad is available at game over, a "Watch Ad to Continue" button appears. Tap this button and watch the ad to completion to recover 50% LIMIT and continue the game.
